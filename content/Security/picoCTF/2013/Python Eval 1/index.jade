	# picoCTF 2013: Python Eval 1 (85)
	---
	## Challenge:
	A wise master wishes to teach you an ancient art: [Python Eval 1](https://picoctf.com/problems/pyeval/stage1.html).

	## Solution:
	The linked page is quite self-explanatory and helpful for techniques. I managed to solve it by tricking the python interpreter to exit, printing out the flag. A simply way to do this is providing the following as Number 1:
	```
	int(flag)
	```
	Doing so we get the following output:
	```
	Welcome to mystery math!
	Enter number 1> int(flag)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
		File "/home/py1/task1.py", line 8, in <module>
			x = input("Enter number 1> ")
		File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
	ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'eval_is_best_thing_evar'
	```
	This leaves us with the final flag:
	```
	eval_is_best_thing_evar
	```
