	# picoCTF 2013: DDoS Detection (85)
	---
	## Challenge:
	It appears a SYN-flood style DDoS has been carried out on this system. Send us a list of the IP addresses of the attackers (in any order, separated by spaces), so we can track them down and stop them.

	Pcap available to download [here](assets/syn_attack.pcap), or available to analyse online at [CloudShark](http://www.cloudshark.org/captures/88971318a309)

	## Solution:
	Looking at the info in the problem we need to filter by SYN packets which can be done via the following filter:
	```
	tcp.flags.syn==1
	```
	After running this filter we we get a list of IPs. Before compiling a list of attacker IPs we must eliminate legitimate users, those with a ACK response and our own IP:
	```
	199.59.148.147
	74.125.228.64
	128.237.255.81
	```
	After elminating packets with those source IPs we can make a nice space seperated list for submission:
	```
	121.168.84.32 75.214.206.60 21.241.212.197 55.53.190.191 71.113.17.64 120.130.138.152 171.128.49.99 104.220.68.36 241.210.41.46 33.24.97.48 115.99.66.210 154.29.81.178 69.232.82.51 234.183.31.38 102.146.88.253 196.132.138.81 63.193.172.89 16.6.74.206 94.148.118.202 160.116.210.243 248.237.9.18 161.147.211.153 207.137.67.221 229.61.253.52 180.70.211.154 132.214.137.24 132.42.241.177 65.248.11.247 49.201.237.5 51.145.58.158
