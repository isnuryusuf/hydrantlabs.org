	# picoCTF 2013: First Contact (40)
	---
	## Challenge:
	You notice that the indicator light near the robotâ€™s antenna begins to blink. Perhaps the robot is connecting to a network? Using a wireless card and the network protocol analyzer Wireshark, you are able to create a PCAP file containing the packets sent over the network.

	You suspect that the robot is communicating with the crashed ship. Your goal is to find the location of the ship by inspecting the network traffic.

	You can perform the analysis online on [Cloudshark](http://www.cloudshark.org/captures/bc1c0a7fae2c) or you can download the [PCAP file](assets/first_contact.pcap).

	## Solution:
	Looking at packet data we see the following combined packet data (I've seperated it with newlines for readability):
	```
	ROBOT BOOTUP INITIALIZING..
	SPACE SHIP READY..
	BOOTUP BEGIN..
	FIRMWARE STATUS.... COMPLETE..
	LOCATION STATUS.... ERROR..
	****BOOT ERROR****..
	COULD NOT READ FROM DISK ID 0xEF982DA0..
	INITIALIZE RECOVERY PROCEDURE 0xCD950422..
	PROCEDURE 0xCD950422 STATUS.... COMPLETE..
	AWAITING NEW LOCATION STATUS..
	NEW LOCATION STATUS: 302..
	NEW LOCATION COORDINATES: 37 14'06"N 115 48'40"W..
	NEW LOCATION INFO: LOCKED..
	NEW LOCATION UPDATE COMPLETE..
	NEW LOCATION UPDATE SUCCESS..
	```
	A [simple google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=37+14%2706%22N+115+48%2740%22W) search of `37 14'06"N 115 48'40"W` tells us these are the coordinates of Area 51. This leaves us with the key:
	```
	Area 51
	```
