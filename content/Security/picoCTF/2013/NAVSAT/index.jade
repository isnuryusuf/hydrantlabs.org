	# picoCTF 2013: NAVSAT (70)
	---
	## Challenge:
	Near the Sun, you find a malfunctioning warp beacon which is broadcasting a distress signal in a navigational channel. It looks like it's been damaged by solar radiation, and [some of its data](assets/recovery.zip) have been corrupted. If you can recover it, perhaps it will point at you to something interesting.

	## Solution:
	First off, if we attempt to download the file and extract it we get the following error:
	```
	Archive:  recovery.zip
	file #1:  bad zipfile offset (local header sig):  0
		inflating: Mag7-BW/Chart-15.pdf
	```
	While it's completely possible to repair the zip file, I took the easier route. I simply ran the following command:
	```shell
	strings -n 10 recovery.zip
	```
	This command will search for ASCII strings greater than or equal to 10 characters in length within the file. The command results in the following output:
	```

	We can clearly see our key in the second row:
